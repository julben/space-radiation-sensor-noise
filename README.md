# Space Radiation Sensor Noise

This project originates from a study I carried out on defects caused by space
radiation environment on in-flight sensors embedded in satellites payloads.

## Introduction

Quality of in-flight images acquired by satellites payloads depends for the most part on image sensors embedded on boards. Consequently, characterizing a sensor is mandatory in order to guarantee the acquired images quality for the entire duration of a satellite a space mission and its results. These embedded sensors are subjected to space radiation environment which can generate defects in the sensor bulk or interfere with the acquisition. Thus, benchmarking and tracking sensors and detector chain performances are challenges which need to be carried out during the space mission lifetime to have a feedback in order to develop more efficient detectors in the future. If we consider the easy way, by the means of dark images acquired in-flight. the performances of a detector and its detection chain in space conditions can be retrieved by examining unusual behaviors of sensors pixels. These atypical pixels can have various effects and causes, they need to be studied specifically to prevent any unwanted behavior for current and future space missions.
